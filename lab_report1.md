## Remote Access and FileSystem (Week 1)
This lab is about the basic filesystem commands:

* Change Directory Command: `cd`
* List Command: `ls`
* Concatenate Command: `cat`

---

### Change Directory Command: `cd`

#### 1. `cd` with no arguments

When the command `cd` is used without any arguments, no visiable output is given by the terminal, as shown below.

`[user@sahara ~]$ cd `

`[user@sahara ~]$ `

But you'll be taken to the user's home directory, if the current directory is not `/home`. 

As shown in the example below, the working directory before running the command is `/lecture1`, and after running the command it became `/home`.

`[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$ pwd`

`/home/lecture1`

`[user@sahara ~]$ cd `

`[user@sahara ~]$ pwd`

`/home`

#### 2. `cd` with a path to a directory as an argument

#### 3. `cd` with a path to a file as an argument

---

### List Command: `ls`

#### `ls` with no arguments

#### `ls` with a path to a directory as an argument

#### `ls` with a path to a file as an argument

---

### Concatenate Command: `cat`

#### `cat` with no arguments

#### `cat` with a path to a directory as an argument

#### `cat` with a path to a file as an argument
